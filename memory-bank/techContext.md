# Technical Context: Autocomplete Component

## Technology Stack
- **React**: Frontend library for building the UI
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **ShadcnUI**: Component library based on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster development

## Development Setup
- Project will be set up using Vite with React and TypeScript template
- ShadcnUI will be installed and configured for UI components
- ESLint and Prettier will be set up for code quality

## API Integration
- Endpoint: `https://autocomplete-lyart.vercel.app/api/words`
- Parameters:
  - `query`: String to search for matching words
  - `limit`: Maximum number of results to return (default: 5)
- Response format: JSON array of strings

## Technical Considerations
- **Debouncing**: Implement debouncing for API calls to prevent excessive requests
- **Caching**: Consider caching previous search results for performance
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Handle API errors and network issues gracefully
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering of suggestion list
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the component works well on different screen sizes
