# Progress: Autocomplete Component

## Completed
- Memory bank initialization
- Project planning and architecture design

## In Progress
- Setting up the project structure
- Creating the basic component hierarchy

## Next Tasks
- Initialize the React + TypeScript project with Vite
- Install and configure ShadcnUI
- Create the API service
- Implement the custom useAutocomplete hook
- Build the core component structure

## Known Issues
- **Module Syntax Mismatch**: Vite projects with `"type": "module"` in package.json require ES module syntax in configuration files (postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.js). Use `export default {}` instead of `module.exports = {}`.
- **Tailwind PostCSS Plugin**: Tailwind CSS's PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of `tailwindcss` directly in the PostCSS configuration.

## Blockers
- None identified

## Overall Status
Project is in initialization phase. We have documented the requirements, planned the architecture, and are ready to start implementation.
