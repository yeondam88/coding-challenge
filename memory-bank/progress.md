# Progress Log

## Current Status: Core Functionality Complete & Documented

All core requirements from the PRD have been met. The application successfully provides autocomplete suggestions, handles user interactions (keyboard and mouse), displays loading/error states, and logs selected items to the console.

### What Works

*   **API Integration**: Successfully fetches suggestions from `https://autocomplete-lyart.vercel.app/api/words`.
*   **Autocomplete Logic**: 
    *   Input field accepts user typing.
    *   Debounced API calls are made as the user types.
    *   Suggestions are displayed below the input.
    *   Matching text in suggestions is highlighted.
*   **User Interaction**:
    *   Keyboard navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape) is fully functional.
    *   Mouse click selection on suggestions works.
    *   Input field can be cleared using a dedicated button.
*   **State Handling**:
    *   Loading state is shown during API calls.
    *   Error state is displayed if API calls fail.
    *   "No results found" message is shown for empty suggestion sets.
*   **Styling**: Basic, clean CSS styling is applied for a functional user experience.
*   **Console Logging**: Selected items are correctly logged to the browser's console.
*   **Testing**: Comprehensive unit/integration test suite implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library, covering:
    *   `apiService.ts` (mocking `fetch`).
    *   `useAutocomplete.ts` hook (all core logic, state changes, event handlers).
    *   `highlightText.tsx` utility.
    *   `AutocompleteInput.tsx` component (rendering based on mocked hook states, user interactions).
    *   `SuggestionItem.tsx` component (rendering, selection, styling based on props) - *though its direct use in `AutocompleteInput` was superseded by internal rendering, its tests remain valid for the component itself.*
    *   `SuggestionsList.tsx` component (conditional rendering logic) - *similarly, its tests are valid for the component logic, though not directly composed in `AutocompleteInput`'s final render.*
*   **Documentation**:
    *   A detailed `README.md` has been added to the `autocomplete-app` directory, covering setup, scripts, and an application flow diagram.
    *   The memory bank file `systemPatterns.md` has been updated with a detailed architecture description, component roles, hook responsibilities, data flow, and a system architecture Mermaid diagram.
    *   This `progress.md` file is up-to-date.

### What's Left to Build (Future Considerations - Outside Initial PRD Scope)

*   More advanced ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility.
*   Refactor `AutocompleteInput.tsx` to delegate suggestion list rendering to `SuggestionsList.tsx` and `SuggestionItem.tsx` for better modularity and separation of concerns.
*   More sophisticated UI/UX design (e.g., animations, theming).
*   End-to-end testing with a tool like Cypress or Playwright.
*   Configurable debounce time or suggestion limits via props.

### Known Issues

*   The `useAutocomplete.test.ts` file shows some `act(...)` warnings related to `console.log` calls. These are deemed acceptable as the functional tests pass and the warnings are likely due to test environment strictness with side effects not directly tied to React state updates that need flushing.
*   The `stderr` output during tests for `apiService.test.ts` shows expected error messages being logged by the `console.error` in `apiService.ts` when testing failure scenarios. This is not an issue with the tests themselves, which correctly assert that errors are thrown.

## Conclusion of Current Phase

The project has successfully met all requirements outlined in the initial PRD. The application is functional, tested, and documented.
