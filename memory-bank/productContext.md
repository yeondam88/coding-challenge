# Product Context: Autocomplete Component

## Problem Statement
Users need a quick way to find and select words while typing, similar to how mobile keyboards provide suggestions. This improves efficiency and reduces typing errors.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Suggestions should appear in real-time as the user types
2. **Visual Clarity**: Matches should be easy to scan and understand
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Allow navigation through suggestions using keyboard
4. **iOS-Inspired Design**: Take inspiration from iOS keyboard autocomplete for a familiar feel
5. **Minimal Friction**: Selection should be intuitive and require minimal effort

## Potential Creative Enhancements
- Highlighting matched characters in suggestions
- Visual indication of selection state
- Smooth animations for suggestions appearing/disappearing
- Categorization of results if applicable
- Smart ranking of suggestions based on relevance

## User Flow
1. User begins typing in the input field
2. System displays matching suggestions from the API
3. User navigates through suggestions using keyboard or mouse
4. User selects a suggestion
5. Selected word is logged to console (and potentially could replace input text in a real application)
