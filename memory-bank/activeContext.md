# Active Context: Autocomplete Component

## Current Focus
We are at the project initiation phase. We need to:
1. Set up the React + TypeScript project with Vite
2. Install and configure ShadcnUI
3. Create the initial component structure
4. Implement the API service and custom hooks
5. Build the UI components with proper styling and interactions

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use React with TypeScript for better type safety
- Chose ShadcnUI for component styling
- Planned to implement debouncing for API calls
- Will support keyboard navigation for better accessibility
- Will highlight matching text in suggestions
- Fixed configuration files to use ES module syntax (`export default {}`) instead of CommonJS syntax (`module.exports = {}`) to match Vite's ES module requirements

## Open Questions
- How should we handle empty responses from the API?
- What should be the default behavior when no input is provided?
- Should we show a loading indicator during API requests?
- How many suggestions should we display by default?
- Should we implement any caching mechanism for performance?

## Next Steps
1. Set up the project structure
2. Create the API service and custom hooks
3. Implement the core autocomplete component
4. Add styling and interactions
5. Handle edge cases and error states
